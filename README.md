## Twitter sentiment analysis

Below were the tasks performed:
1) Access live tweet data using twitter development account
2) Derive the sentiment of each tweet
- A list of sentiment words was available, where number of words had a sentiment score assigned, eg. happy  +3
- This information is available in the file AFINN-111.txt
3) Derive the sentiment of the new terms
4) Compute term frequency
5) Find the top ten trending hashtags
6) Use the tweet object data for analyses
 Here, I accessed the country of the tweet, and computed the total sentiment score for various countries from the limited number of tweets retrieved.
